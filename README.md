# Ticketing-System

A project I created as a part of my Object Oriented Programming module.

Instructions on how to run the program:
  1. Go into the "src" folder and open a terminal.
  2. Type and enter the "java TicketingSystemCLI" command.
  3. If you wish to open the GUI in a browser enter "y" when prompted.
